## Overview

The **AICAM Intrusion module** is a **boundary-crossing evidence recorder** designed for Raspberry Pi OS using a CSI camera.

Its purpose is **not** to decide intent, issue alerts, or interpret behavior.

Its purpose is to:

> **Record verifiable evidence when a human crosses a defined boundary.**

This module follows the core AICAM project principle:

> *All you can truly protect is the few feet around you.*

## What This Module Does

- Captures video from a **Raspberry Pi CSI camera** using **Picamera2 / libcamera**
- Runs **YOLOv5 (ONNX)** inference using **onnxruntime (CPU)**
- Detects **persons only** (YOLO class `0`)
- Monitors a **single, explicitly defined boundary line**
- When a person’s **bounding-box center crosses the line**:
  - Saves **preroll + postroll video**
  - Writes **JSONL event records**
  - Preserves model provenance

## What This Module Explicitly Does *Not* Do

No tracking, no alerts, no networking, no cloud calls, no Ultralytics, no `/dev/video*`.

## Run Command

```bash
python3 -u INTRUSIONCAM_PICAMERA2_HARDENED.py
```

## Boundary Examples

```python
LINE_A = (0, CAM_HEIGHT // 2)
LINE_B = (CAM_WIDTH, CAM_HEIGHT // 2)
```

## Summary

Preserve truth inside a boundary.
